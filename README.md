# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Overview
This interactive dashboard project is designed to explore the microbs found in human navels. Utilizing the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, the dashboard provides insights into the diverse species of microbes, known as Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), residing in the belly button.

## Dataset
The Belly Button Biodiversity dataset compiles the results of microbiome samples taken from human navels.

## Features
The dashboard includes the following interactive elements:

**-Sample Selection Dropdown:** Allows users to select different individuals' sample IDs to view their microbial data.

**-Demographic Information Panel:** Displays demographic information related to the selected individual's sample.

**-Bar Chart:** Illustrates the top 10 OTUs found in the selected individual. It provides a visual representation of the relative frequency of each microbe.

**-Bubble Chart:** Showcases the distribution of all microbial species found in the selected sample. Each bubble's size and color represent the abundance and diversity of the microbes.

**-Gauge Chart:** Indicates the belly button washing frequency of the selected individual, visualized through a gauge meter ranging from 0 to 9.

## Technology Stack
**JavaScript:** Primary programming language for dashboard functionality.

**D3.js:** A JavaScript library used to manipulate documents based on data and to bind data to the DOM.

**Plotly.js:** JavaScript graphing library used to create the bar, bubble, and gauge charts.

**HTML/CSS:** Used for structuring and styling the dashboard's webpage.


# Usage
To use the dashboard, simply select a sample ID from the dropdown menu. The dashboard will automatically update all visualizations and information panels to reflect data associated with the selected sample.
